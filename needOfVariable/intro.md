What is a Variable?

    A variable is a name given to a value stored in memory.
    A variable is used to store data so we can reuse it later.

Without variables, programs would be:
    Hard to understand
    Hard to change
    Impossible to resuse values

Variable solves this problem
Variable allow us to store the values in memory.
