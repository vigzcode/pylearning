What is a Tuple in Python
    A tuple is a collection of items stored in a single variable, just like a list, but tuples are immutable.

How to Create a Tuple
    t1 = (1, 2, 3)
    t2 = ("Python", "Java", "C")
    t3 = (1, "Hello", 3.14)

Single-Element Tuple (Important!)

    t = (10,)   # correct

❌ Not a tuple:
    t = (10)    # this is just an int
