An escape sequence is a special character combination that starts with a backslash (\n).

It is used to:

    Add special characters in strings
    Control formatting (new line, tab, etc.)
    Insert characters that are otherwise hard to type


Why Do We Need Escape Sequences?
    Some characters have special meaning or are not visible, like:
        New line
        Tab space
        Qoutes inside strings

basically, Escape sequences help us represent these characters inside a string.
