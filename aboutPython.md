Python – Simple Overview
    Python is a high-level, interpreted, and easy-to-learn programming language.
    It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.
    Python is widely used because of its simple syntax, readability, and developer-friendly nature.

Some of the Key Features of Python 

    1. Dynamically Typed Language
        Python is a dynamically typed language, which means we do not need to declare the data type of a variable.
        In languages like C, we must specify the type:
            int i = 10;
        In Python, we can directly assign values:
            i = 10
            i = "hello"
            i = 15.5
        The type is automatically handled by Python at runtime.

    2. User-Friendly Language

        Python is very easy to write and understand.

        Example in C:
            #include <stdio.h>

            int main() {
                printf("Hello World");
                return 0;
            }   

        Example in Python:
            print("Hello World")

        Python needs less code to do the same task.

    3. Readability
        Python code is easy to read because:
            Simple syntax
            Uses indentation instead of brackets
            Looks close to the English language
        This makes Python code easy to understand and maintain.

    4. Developer Productivity

        Python helps developers work faster.
            Best language for scripting
            Strong community support
            Large number of libraries
            Supports Rapid Application Development (RAD)

What Can We Do with Python?
    Python is used in many areas:
        GUI Applications
        Web Development
        Image Processing
        Scripting and Automation
        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning


Python Drawback
    Execution speed is slower compared to low-level languages like C and C++
