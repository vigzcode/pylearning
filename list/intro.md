What is a List in Python?
    A list is a collection of items stored in a single variable.
    It's used to store multiple values together.

Why Do We Need Lists?
    Without a list:
        a = 10
        b = 20
        c = 30
    with a list:
        numbers = [10, 20, 30]
✔ Less code
✔ Easy to manage
✔ Easy to loop
