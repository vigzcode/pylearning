What is a Group Statement in Python?
    In Python, a group statement means a block of code that belongs together.
    Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to group statements.
    There are no braces {} like in C or Java.
    Indentation defines the group.

Why Group Statements Are Needed
    Group statements are used when:
        We want to run multiple lines of code together
        Based on a condition, loop, or function
    Examples:
        if statement
        for loop
        while loop
        functions
        classes


Key Points to Remember
    Python uses indentation to group statements
    All lines with same indentation level belong to the same group
    : (colon) starts a new block
    Proper indentation is mandatory
