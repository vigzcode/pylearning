What are Decision-Making Statements in Python?
    Decision-making statements allow a program to choose what to do based on conditions.

Why Do We Need Decision-Making Statements?
    Without decision making, a program runs line by line with no choices.

Decision making lets us:    
    Compare values
    Check conditions
    Execute different code blocks

if Statement
if – else
Nested if elif

if Statement
    Used when you want to run code only if a condition is true.
    syntax:
        if condition:
            statement

if – else Statement
    Used when you want one block if true and another if false.
    syntax:
        if condition:
            statement
        else:
            statement

Nested if elif
    Used when you have multiple conditions.
    syntax:
        if condition:
            statement
        elif condition:
            statement
        elif condition:
            statement
        else:
            statement
